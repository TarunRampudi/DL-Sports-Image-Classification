## Project Overview

This project is focused on building a deep learning based image classification system for recognizing and classifying sports images. The aim is to train models that can distinguish among different sports from images, and evaluate their performance (accuracy, loss, etc.).

## Features

- Preprocessing of images: resizing, normalization, augmentation 
- Multiple models / experiments (skill1.py, skill9.py, etc.)  
- Training, validation, and evaluation pipelines  
- Presentations or documentation summarizing findings (`DLL.pptx`)  

## Dataset

- Source of images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification  
- Number of classes 100 Sports Types  
- Number of images per class approximately 15
- Any important preprocessing steps image size, data augmentation,RLU etc.

## Model Architecture / Approach

- What architectures have been tried CNN, transfer learning from pretrained networks, etc.  
- Details of layers, activation functions, loss function, optimizer, number of epochs, batch size 30 ,60 
- Any special methods used fine-tuning, regularization, etc.  

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TarunRampudi/DL-Sports-Image-Classification.git
   cd DL-Sports-Image-Classification
